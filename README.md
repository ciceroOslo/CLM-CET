# CLM-CET
### Community Land Model-Central European Time discussion forum 

This repo is primarily designed to serve as a home for the CLM-CET discussion forum. The [wiki](https://github.com/rosiealice/CLM-CET/wiki) contains the plans, agendas and slides from these meetings, in addition to any relevant notes. 

The use of this repo will likely evolve in tne course of discussion within the group. 

It does not currently contain any code. Code for the CLM model can be found [here](https://github.com/ESCOMP/ctsm)

and for the FATES model [here](https://github.com/NGEET/fates)

Official technical support on these models and their use can be reached via the links provided on their respective sites. 

This forum is intended an additional unofficial resource to share expertise, tools, scientific networks and ideas around the use and development of the CLM  It is primarily aimed at european researchers, as one major raison d'Ãªtre is to have meetings during the european working day, but it is open to anyone who might wish to join.
