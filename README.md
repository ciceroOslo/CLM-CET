# CLM-CET
### Community Land Model-Central European Time discussion forum 

#### This repo is: 
 a home for the CLM-CET discussion forum.and acts in parallel with a series of monthly online meetings at 2.30 CET Fridays [see schedule](https://github.com/rosiealice/CLM-CET/wiki/Upcoming-meetings) . It is intended an additional unofficial resource to share expertise, tools, scientific networks and ideas around the use and development of the Community Land Model. It is primarily aimed at european researchers, as one major raison d'Ãªtre is to have meetings during the european working day. **It is open to any researchers interested in these topics who might wish to join **

#### This repo is not: 
intended in any way to be a European branch of the CLM. It does not contain any code. 

Code for the CLM model can be found [here](https://github.com/ESCOMP/ctsm)
and for the FATES model [here](https://github.com/NGEET/fates)

Official technical support, users guides and issues fora for these models can be found via their respective sites. Posting of issues with code should remain on those sites for the sake of rational triage of issues. 

On this site [wiki](https://github.com/rosiealice/CLM-CET/wiki) contains the plans, agendas and slides from these meetings, in addition to any relevant notes. 
The [discussion](https://github.com/rosiealice/CLM-CET/discussions) page contains ideas for future meetings, and introductions from members of the European CLM community.
