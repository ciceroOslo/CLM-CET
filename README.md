# CLM-CET
### Community Land Model-Central European Time discussion forum 

#### This repo is 
 a home for the CLM-CET discussion forum. The purpose of this forum is to promote discussion among european and other users of the Community Land Model, to act in parallel with a series of monthly online meetings at 2.30 CET Fridays (see below). This forum is intended an additional unofficial resource to share expertise, tools, scientific networks and ideas around the use and development of the CLM. It is primarily aimed at european researchers, as one major raison d'Ãªtre is to have meetings during the european working day. **It is open to any researchers interested in these topics who might wish to join **

#### This repo is not 
intended in any way to be a European branch of the CLM. It does not contain any code. 

Code for the CLM model can be found [here](https://github.com/ESCOMP/ctsm)
and for the FATES model [here](https://github.com/NGEET/fates)

Official technical support, users guides and issues fora for these models can be found via their respective sites. Posting of issues with code should remain on those sites for the sake of rational triage of issues. 

On this site [wiki](https://github.com/rosiealice/CLM-CET/wiki) contains the plans, agendas and slides from these meetings, in addition to any relevant notes. 
The [discussion](https://github.com/rosiealice/CLM-CET/discussions) page contains ideas for future meetings, and introductions from members of the European CLM community. 

Meetings are currently planned to be monthly, at 2.30p.m. on Friday (see wiki) using Microsoft Teams as the forum.
